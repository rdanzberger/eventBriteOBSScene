# This simple HTML page will facilitate you creating a scene in OBS to share with friends.
# One of the first things you'll need to do enroll with EventBrite's Developer Program, and then register an API key with your event brite account, which can be be found in their API documentation.  Once you have your OAuth Token, you can input that in the index.js file.
# Currently, the code requires you to go in and update the event ID which can be found in the query string paramater of the event if you nagivate to it on EventBrite, but this naturally better than recreating a "slide" each time a new event is created for you to help crowd source amongst your teams/events you may be attending.
